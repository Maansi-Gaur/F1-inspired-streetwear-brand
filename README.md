* Throttle Theory<br>
<br>
This is a simple frontend website I created for a fictional streetwear brand called *Throttle Theory*, inspired by Formula 1.  
The goal was to design a clean, dark-themed landing page using just HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript — no frameworks involved.<br>
<br>
* What’s in it?<br>
<br>
- A hero section with brand tagline and call-to-action button<br>
- A featured product section with 3 items (Speed Tee, Turbo Jacket, Podium Cap)<br>
- A short “About” section explaining the brand vibe<br>
- A smooth scroll when you click on “Explore Collection”<br>
- Fully responsive design — works on mobile too<br>
<br>
* Built With<br>
<br>
- HTML  <br>
- CSS  <br>
- JavaScript  <br>
- Google Fonts (Inter)<br>
<br>
 * Files Included<br>
<br>
- index.html – all the main content  
- style.css – handles layout, colors, spacing  
- script.js – adds smooth scroll when clicking the button
